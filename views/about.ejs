      <p class="pAbout">We are a global collective of womxn working at the intersection of art and AI. 
        We believe that technology is both inspiration and instrument, and are engaged
        in projects that explore the creative, social and ethical implications of AI.</p>
      <p class="pAbout">Our network includes visual artists, performers, researchers, writers, coders, dancers, curators, creative technologists
        and others who in their own unique way and across many disciplines spark conversation, shift perception and shape culture.</p>
      <p class="pAbout">Our name foregrounds a subversive, non-patriarchal approach that encompasses all womxn, including trans,
         non-binary and women of color. Whether practicing alone or in a group, we join together here to identify and discuss 
         challenges and opportunities; to share resources and support; to empower serious consideration of underrepresented ideas and inventions; 
         and to amplify important yet underheard voices and discussions relating to artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p class="pAbout">At a time when advances in AI are blurring the historic definitions of art and artists, we are dedicated to unlocking the 
        infinite possibilities of human-machine collaboration and inventing new modes of expression&mdash;using
        creativity and technology as tools to pose and probe fundamental questions, and promote greater understanding.</p>
